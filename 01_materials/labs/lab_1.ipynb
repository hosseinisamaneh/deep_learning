        "# Training Neural Networks with Keras\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first practical session of the course! In this session, we will learn how to train neural networks with Keras. We will start with a simple example of a feedforward neural network for classification and then we will study the impact of the initialization of the weights on the convergence of the training algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keras is a high-level neural network API, built on top of TensorFlow 2.0. It provides a user-friendly interface to build, train and deploy deep learning models. Keras is designed to be modular, fast and easy to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this course, we will focus on using Keras and TensorFlow for building and training neural networks. However, there are other popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, MXNet, CNTK, etc. that you can also use to build and train neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to use our code on Google Colab, we will need to ensure that any required packages are installed. We will use the following packages in this session:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `tensorflow`: an open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.\n",
        "- `matplotlib`: a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.\n",
        "- `numpy`: a library for scientific computing in Python.\n",
        "- `scikit-learn`: a machine learning library for the Python programming language.\n",
        "- `pandas`: a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, we will be working with the famous MNIST dataset. MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a database of low resolution images of handwritten digits. The history here is interesting - the dataset was originally created in the 1980s, when researchers from the aforementioned institute collected samples from American Census Bureau employees and high school students. The dataset was then modified in the 1990s (hence the M in MNIST), and has since become a popular benchmark for machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit. The goal is to classify each image into one of the 10 possible classes (0-9).\n",
        "\n",
        "![MNIST](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scikit-Learn library provides a convenient function to download and load the MNIST dataset. The following cell will download the dataset. Then we will take a look at the shape of the data."
